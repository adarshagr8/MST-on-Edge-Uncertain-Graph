# MST-on-Edge-Uncertain-Graph

### Introduction
The project was aimed towards fulfillment of B.Tech Project Requirements Third Year B.Tech. We consider the problem of finding a minimum spanning tree of a graph where some of the edge weights are unknown and only their upper and lower bounds are available, but these edges can be explored to reveal their actual weight at an extra cost. The goal here is to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an edge-uncertain graph by exploring the minimum number of edges. We compare the performances of two online greedy algorithms with that of an optimal algorithm, which utilizes the information about actual weights of the uncertain edges to find the minimum number of queries needed to narrow down the MST. 

## How to run?

Run the python file "main.py" in order to run the code first against manual test cases. The program will prompt for the number of random test cases to be generated next and would execute against randomly generated testcases with _|V|_ = 100 and _|E| âˆˆ [100, 200]_ .
